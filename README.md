# GENERIC-CL

GENERIC-CL aims to provide an extensible generic function interface to
standard Common Lisp functions which are not implemented as generic
functions and are hence not extensible. Examples of such functions are
equality predicates and sequence operations.

_GENERIC-CL is currently in very early stages of development_
