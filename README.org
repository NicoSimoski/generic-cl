* GENRIC-CL

GENERIC-CL provides a generic function wrapper over various functions
in the Common Lisp standard, such as equality predicates and sequence
operations. The goal of the wrapper is to provide a standard interface
to common operations, such as testing for the equality of two objects,
which is extensible to user-defined types.

** Usage

The generic function interface is contained in the ~GENERIC-CL~
package. This package should be used rather than ~COMMON-LISP~, as it
shadows the symbols, in the ~COMMON-LISP~ package, which name a
function for which there is a generic function wrapper. The
~GENERIC-CL~ additionally reexports the remaining non-shadowed symbols
in ~COMMON-LISP~.

** Generic Interfaces

*** Equality
*** Comparison
*** Arithmetic
*** Iterator
*** Collector
*** Sequence Operations
*** Generic Hash-Tables
*** Set Operations
