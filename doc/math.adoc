=== Math ===

System and package name `GENERIC-CL.MATH`.

This interface provides generic function wrappers are provided over a
number of math functions. Methods specialized on `NUMBER` are
provided, which simply call the corresponding functions in the `CL`
package. The purpose of this interface is to allow the mathematical
functions to be extended to vectors and matrices.

This interface is not exported by the `GENERIC-CL` package, as it's
not as frequently used as the previous interfaces. The
`GENERIC-MATH-CL` package exports all symbols exports by the
`GENERIC-CL` package and the shadowed math functions in
`GENERIC-CL.MATH`.

Generic function wrappers are provided for the following functions:

* `SIN`
* `COS`
* `TAN`
* `ASIN`
* `ACOS`
* `ATAN`
* `SINH`
* `COSH`
* `TANH`
* `ASINH`
* `ACOSH`
* `ATANH`
* `EXP`
* `EXPT`
* `LOG`
* `SQRT`
* `ISQRT`
* `REALPART`
* `IMAGPART`
* `CIS`
* `CONJUGATE`
* `PHASE`
* `NUMERATOR`
* `DENOMINATOR`
* `RATIONAL`
* `RATIONALIZE`
